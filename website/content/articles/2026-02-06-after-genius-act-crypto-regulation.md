summary: "The GENIUS Act proved that Congress can craft sensible digital asset legislation — clear rules, existing regulatory structures, proportionate requirements. As lawmakers now tackle market structure, DeFi, and jurisdictional clarity, they should follow the same model: regulatory clarity that protects consumers without pushing innovation offshore."

## A Template Worth Repeating

On July 18, 2025, President Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act — the GENIUS Act — into law. It was the first major piece of digital asset legislation to clear both chambers of Congress, ending nearly a decade of regulatory limbo for an industry that had grown to trillions of dollars in market capitalization without a coherent federal framework. The law defined what stablecoins are, established reserve and transparency requirements for issuers, and assigned oversight responsibilities to existing federal and state regulators rather than inventing a new bureaucracy.

The GENIUS Act was not perfect. But it was proof of concept. It demonstrated that Congress can write cryptocurrency legislation that provides the regulatory clarity the industry needs without resorting to either blanket hostility or uncritical enthusiasm. The question now is whether the next phase of digital asset regulation — market structure bills, DeFi governance, SEC and CFTC jurisdictional boundaries — will follow the same model or succumb to the twin temptations of overregulation and turf protection.

The stakes are considerable. The global digital asset market now exceeds $3.5 trillion. Tokenized real-world assets — from Treasury bonds to real estate — are approaching $20 billion. Cross-border stablecoin payments are displacing legacy remittance networks that charge migrants exorbitant fees. Decentralized finance protocols are providing financial services to populations that traditional banks have ignored. None of this will remain in the United States if Congress gets the next round of regulation wrong.

## What the GENIUS Act Got Right

The GENIUS Act succeeded for three reasons that should serve as a template for future digital asset legislation.

**First, it defined its terms clearly.** Before the GENIUS Act, there was no federal statutory definition of a "payment stablecoin." The SEC, CFTC, OCC, and state regulators each applied their own interpretations, creating an incoherent patchwork that made compliance a guessing game. The Act established a clear definition — a digital asset pegged to a fixed monetary value, backed by reserves, and designed for use as a medium of exchange — and built its regulatory requirements around that definition. This may sound elementary, but in the digital asset space, where regulators had spent years arguing over whether tokens were securities, commodities, or something else entirely, definitional clarity was revolutionary.

**Second, it used existing regulatory structures.** Rather than creating a new federal agency or a bespoke licensing regime, the GENIUS Act assigned oversight to the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and state banking regulators depending on the size and type of the issuer. Large nonbank issuers — those with more than $10 billion in outstanding stablecoins — fall under Federal Reserve supervision. Smaller issuers can operate under state frameworks that meet federal standards. Insured depository institutions issue stablecoins under their existing bank charters. This approach leveraged decades of institutional expertise rather than building from scratch, and it respected the dual federal-state banking system that has long been a feature of American financial regulation.

**Third, it imposed proportionate requirements.** The Act mandated one-to-one reserve backing with high-quality liquid assets — U.S. Treasuries, insured deposits, central bank reserves — and required monthly attestations and periodic audits. These are serious requirements that address the genuine consumer protection concern that stablecoins could become instruments of fractional-reserve banking outside the regulated system. But the Act did not impose bank-like capital requirements, activity restrictions, or compliance burdens that would have made stablecoin issuance viable only for the largest financial institutions. It calibrated its demands to the actual risks.

The results have vindicated the approach. In the seven months since enactment, several major stablecoin issuers have registered under the new framework. Institutional adoption of dollar-denominated stablecoins has accelerated, with stablecoins in circulation surpassing $200 billion. Capital that had been flowing to offshore jurisdictions has begun returning to the United States. The GENIUS Act did exactly what good regulation is supposed to do: it created a predictable operating environment that attracted legitimate actors while giving regulators the tools to go after bad ones.

## The Unfinished Agenda

Stablecoins, however, are only one piece of the digital asset ecosystem. Significant gaps remain, and Congress needs to address them before the current momentum dissipates.

**Market structure legislation is the most urgent priority.** The central unresolved question in digital asset regulation is deceptively simple: which tokens are securities, which are commodities, and who regulates what? The SEC under Chair Gary Gensler famously asserted that virtually all crypto tokens other than Bitcoin were securities. The CFTC claimed jurisdiction over tokens that function as commodities. Courts offered inconsistent guidance — the *SEC v. Ripple* decision in 2023 held that the same token could be a security in one context and not another, a conclusion that satisfied no one.

The current Congress has an opportunity to settle this. The bipartisan market structure bills under discussion in both chambers would establish clear criteria for when a digital asset qualifies as a security versus a commodity, create a registration pathway for digital asset exchanges, and delineate SEC and CFTC jurisdiction. These bills are not about deregulating crypto — they are about ending the jurisdictional ambiguity that has made compliance impossible and litigation inevitable. An exchange that wants to list both security tokens and commodity tokens currently faces the absurd prospect of needing to register with two different agencies under two different frameworks, neither of which was designed for digital assets. This is not a system that protects consumers; it is a system that protects regulatory turf.

**DeFi governance requires a novel approach.** Decentralized finance protocols — automated, code-based systems that provide lending, trading, and other financial services without traditional intermediaries — present a genuine regulatory challenge that the GENIUS Act did not address. The difficulty is fundamental: DeFi protocols often have no central operator to regulate. A decentralized exchange like Uniswap is a set of smart contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain; there is no CEO to subpoena, no corporate headquarters to inspect, no single entity that "operates" the exchange in any traditional sense.

This does not mean DeFi should be unregulated. It means regulation needs to be thoughtful about where in the stack to intervene. One promising approach focuses on the points of centralization that exist even in ostensibly decentralized systems: front-end interfaces, token governance structures, and the development teams that deploy and upgrade protocols. Another focuses on the on-ramps and off-ramps — the exchanges and wallets where users convert between fiat currency and digital assets — which are already subject to Bank Secrecy Act requirements. What will not work is simply declaring that existing securities or banking laws apply to DeFi protocols as written. The technology is too different, and the enforcement challenges are too severe.

**Regulatory coordination needs legislative grounding.** The GENIUS Act implicitly addressed the turf problem for stablecoins by assigning clear jurisdiction. But in the broader digital asset space, the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, OCC, FDIC, and state regulators continue to operate under overlapping and sometimes contradictory mandates. Executive coordination — task forces, memoranda of understanding — is insufficient. Congress should establish by statute which agency has primary jurisdiction over which categories of digital assets and create a formal interagency coordination mechanism with real authority.

## The End of Regulation by Enforcement

The most significant shift of the past year has been philosophical. For the better part of a decade, the United States regulated digital assets primarily through enforcement actions. Rather than writing rules, agencies — the SEC in particular — sued companies and then cited the resulting settlements and court decisions as de facto regulatory guidance. This approach had two devastating consequences.

First, it created a compliance environment where the rules were unknowable in advance. Companies could not determine with confidence whether their products were legal until a regulator decided to sue them. This is antithetical to the rule of law. Businesses in every other industry can read the relevant statutes and regulations, consult with lawyers, and structure their activities to comply. Crypto companies were asked to comply with rules that did not exist yet.

Second, regulation by enforcement drove innovation offshore. When Coinbase sought SEC guidance on how to register as a securities exchange for digital assets, the SEC's response was to sue the company. The message to the industry was clear: do not ask for permission, because you will not get it — but if you proceed, you will be punished. Companies rationally concluded that operating in more hospitable jurisdictions — the EU, the UK, Singapore, the UAE — was preferable to navigating an American regulatory environment that seemed designed to produce gotcha enforcement actions rather than workable compliance frameworks.

The GENIUS Act, combined with the current SEC's more constructive posture under new leadership, has begun to reverse this dynamic. But the change needs to be made durable through legislation, not just leadership. Future administrations could revert to enforcement-first approaches unless Congress codifies clear rules that give both the industry and regulators predictable frameworks to operate within.

## The International Competition

The United States does not regulate digital assets in a vacuum. The European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which took full effect in late 2024, has created the most comprehensive digital asset regulatory framework in the world. The United Kingdom has been implementing its own regime through the Financial Conduct Authority. Singapore, the UAE, Hong Kong, and Japan have all established regulatory sandboxes or bespoke frameworks designed to attract digital asset companies.

MiCA is instructive as both a model and a cautionary tale. Its comprehensiveness provides the regulatory certainty that companies crave — every digital asset issuer and service provider operating in the EU knows exactly what is required of them. But its prescriptiveness has drawn criticism for imposing compliance costs that favor incumbents and for restricting certain DeFi activities in ways that may push innovation outside the EU. The stablecoin provisions, in particular, have been criticized as so restrictive that they effectively reserve issuance for established financial institutions.

The United States should learn from MiCA's strengths — comprehensive scope, clear definitions, consistent application — without replicating its weaknesses. American digital asset regulation should be principles-based rather than prescriptive, flexible enough to accommodate technological evolution, and calibrated to avoid creating barriers to entry that would concentrate the industry among a handful of large players. The GENIUS Act struck roughly the right balance for stablecoins. The challenge is extending that balance across the broader digital asset ecosystem.

If Congress fails to act with appropriate speed, the competition for digital asset capital and talent will continue to favor jurisdictions that have already established clear rules. The United States still benefits from deep capital markets, the dollar's reserve currency status, and a robust legal system. But these advantages are not permanent. Every month that the regulatory framework remains incomplete is a month in which companies, developers, and capital make long-term location decisions based on the rules that exist — and right now, clearer rules exist elsewhere.

## Remaining Risks

Two risks deserve candid acknowledgment.

The first is that the pendulum swings too far. The legitimate frustration with regulation by enforcement could curdle into an anything-goes posture that ignores genuine consumer protection concerns. The digital asset industry has real fraud problems — from the collapse of FTX to the endless stream of rug pulls, pump-and-dump schemes, and deceptive token launches that have cost retail investors billions. The answer to the SEC's prior overreach is not to dismantle investor protection; it is to build a framework that catches fraud effectively while allowing legitimate innovation to proceed. The FTX collapse was not caused by too much regulation or too little — it was caused by straightforward fraud that existing laws already prohibited. The failure was enforcement, not statutory. Clearer rules would make such enforcement faster and more effective, not weaker.

The second risk is that DeFi proves genuinely resistant to effective governance. It is possible that some decentralized protocols are sufficiently decentralized that no regulatory intervention short of blocking internet traffic can control them. If so, policymakers will need to accept that regulation can operate only at the edges — the on-ramps, the off-ramps, the interfaces — and that attempting to regulate the protocols themselves will be futile and counterproductive. This is not a comfortable conclusion for regulators, but intellectual honesty requires confronting it.

## Recommendations

The GENIUS Act provided a foundation. Building on it requires five concrete steps:

1. **Pass market structure legislation in 2026.** Congress should enact a bill that clearly defines which digital assets are securities, which are commodities, and which are neither, and should assign primary regulatory jurisdiction accordingly. The current bipartisan proposals provide a workable starting point.

2. **Establish a DeFi regulatory framework based on points of centralization.** Rather than attempting to regulate decentralized protocols directly, focus on the identifiable entities — front-end operators, governance token holders with meaningful control, fiat on-ramps and off-ramps — that provide leverage for consumer protection and anti-money-laundering compliance.

3. **Create a statutory interagency coordination mechanism.** A Digital Asset Regulatory Council, modeled on FSOC but with a narrower mandate, should coordinate policy across the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, OCC, and state regulators to eliminate jurisdictional gaps and overlaps.

4. **Maintain proportionality.** Regulatory requirements should be calibrated to the actual risks posed by different categories of digital assets and activities. A fully collateralized stablecoin does not present the same risks as a leveraged DeFi lending protocol, and the regulatory burden should reflect that difference.

5. **Engage actively in international standard-setting.** The United States should lead, not follow, in multilateral forums like the Financial Stability Board and FATF to ensure that global digital asset standards reflect American interests and values.

The GENIUS Act proved that clarity is possible. The task now is to extend that clarity to the rest of the digital asset ecosystem — deliberately, proportionately, and with an unwavering focus on keeping American innovation onshore.
