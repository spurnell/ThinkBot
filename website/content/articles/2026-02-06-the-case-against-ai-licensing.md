## The Licensing Temptation

As artificial intelligence systems grow more capable, a familiar policy instinct has re-emerged: license the developers. Several recent legislative proposals — at both the state and federal level — would require AI companies to obtain government approval before training or deploying models above certain capability thresholds. The appeal is intuitive: we license doctors, lawyers, and pilots, so why not the builders of powerful AI systems?

The answer is that AI development is fundamentally different from professional practice, and importing a licensing framework would do more harm than good. Licensing regimes are designed for mature, well-understood fields with stable knowledge bases. AI is none of these things. Imposing licensure on a rapidly evolving technology would freeze development patterns, entrench incumbents, and create barriers to entry that disproportionately harm startups, academic researchers, and open-source contributors.

## The Innovation Cost

Every licensing regime creates compliance costs. For large companies like Google, Microsoft, and Anthropic, these costs are manageable — they already employ armies of lawyers and policy teams. But for a two-person startup in a garage, or a university lab exploring novel architectures, licensing requirements could be prohibitive.

This is not a hypothetical concern. The history of technology regulation is littered with examples where well-intentioned rules became moats for incumbents. The EU's GDPR, for instance, increased market concentration in digital advertising by imposing compliance costs that only the largest players could absorb. An AI licensing regime would produce the same dynamic: fewer competitors, less innovation, and ultimately worse outcomes for consumers.

The numbers tell the story. According to the National Science Foundation, the United States leads the world in AI research output, with over 40% of top-cited AI papers coming from American institutions. Much of this research happens in settings — universities, small labs, open-source communities — that would struggle under a licensing regime. Threatening this ecosystem in the name of safety is a trade-off that demands far more justification than proponents have offered.

## The Regulatory Competence Problem

Licensing requires a licensor — a government body with the expertise to evaluate AI systems and their developers. No such body exists, and creating one would take years. In the meantime, the technology will have evolved in ways that make any initial licensing criteria obsolete.

Consider the pace of change: in the last two years alone, we have seen the emergence of multimodal models, massive improvements in reasoning capabilities, the rise of open-weight models, and the development of AI agents that can use tools and write code. A licensing framework designed in 2026 would be evaluating a technology landscape that bears little resemblance to the one that will exist in 2028.

This is the core problem with ex-ante regulation of fast-moving technologies. Regulators are inevitably working with yesterday's map. The NIST AI Risk Management Framework offers a better model: voluntary, flexible, and designed to evolve with the technology rather than constrain it.

## What We Should Do Instead

Rejecting AI licensing does not mean rejecting all governance. It means choosing the right kind of governance. Three principles should guide the approach:

**First, use existing law.** Healthcare AI should be regulated by the FDA. Financial AI by the SEC and CFPB. Employment AI by the EEOC. These agencies understand their sectors and can apply existing frameworks to AI applications within them. New horizontal AI regulation is unnecessary when sector-specific regulators already have the tools and authority they need.

**Second, focus on outcomes, not inputs.** Rather than licensing who can build AI, hold developers accountable for what their systems do. If an AI system causes demonstrable harm — discriminatory hiring decisions, dangerous medical advice, fraudulent financial recommendations — existing tort law and sector-specific regulations provide remedies. This approach targets actual harms rather than hypothetical ones.

**Third, invest in standards, not mandates.** The NIST AI Risk Management Framework is an excellent foundation. Voluntary adoption, industry best practices, and market incentives (customers demanding responsible AI) will produce better outcomes than government mandates. Companies that adopt robust safety practices will earn trust and market share; those that don't will face reputational and legal consequences.

## Conclusion

The impulse to license AI developers is understandable but misguided. It would impose significant costs on innovation with little corresponding benefit to safety. The United States' AI leadership — which is a strategic asset in competition with China — depends on maintaining an open, competitive, and dynamic development ecosystem. Policymakers should resist the licensing temptation and instead pursue targeted, sector-specific, outcomes-based approaches that address genuine risks without throttling the most transformative technology of our time.
