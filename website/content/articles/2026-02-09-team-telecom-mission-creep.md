---

On January 8, 2026, the Federal Communications Commission announced its [first-ever enforcement action](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-417571A1.pdf) under a Team Telecom mitigation agreement, fining satellite operator Marlink $175,000 for allowing 186 foreign employees to access U.S. communications infrastructure without prior Department of Justice approval. While national security oversight of telecommunications carriers is legitimate, this enforcement action reveals troubling scope creep from foreign ownership review into day-to-day operational micromanagement.

The timing is particularly notable. Just one day after this enforcement action, the Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled a [February 10 hearing](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/arctic-frost-accountability-oversight-of-telecommunications-carriers-responses-to-jack-smiths-witch-hunt) examining telecommunications carriers' responses to former Special Counsel Jack Smith's "Arctic Frost" subpoenas — requests that swept up phone records for [over 400 Republican targets](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/new-jack-smith-subpoenaed-records-for-over-400-republican-targets-as-part-of-arctic-frost), including at least [13 Members of Congress](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-backs-permanent-subcommittee-on-investigations-subpoenas-to-atandt-verizon-and-lumen-for-records-identifying-arctic-frost-targets). Telecom carriers now face competing pressures: aggressive compliance enforcement from regulators on one side, and political backlash over cooperation with prosecutors on the other.

## From Foreign Ownership to Foreign Employees

Team Telecom has operated informally for over two decades as an interagency committee comprising the Department of Justice, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Defense. [Formalized by Executive Order 13913 in April 2020](https://www.justice.gov/nsd/team-telecom), the committee reviews FCC applications for telecommunications licenses with significant foreign ownership or control, assessing national security and law enforcement risks.

The process works like this: When an applicant meets certain foreign ownership thresholds, the FCC refers the application to Team Telecom. The committee submits detailed questions about ownership, business practices, and security protocols. Based on the responses, Team Telecom may recommend approval, denial, or — most commonly — negotiate a "mitigation agreement" imposing operational restrictions to address security concerns.

These mitigation agreements typically address structural concerns: limits on foreign board representation, restrictions on where sensitive data can be stored, network security protocols, and oversight mechanisms. The Marlink case, however, reveals a different kind of requirement: mandatory pre-approval from the DOJ at least 30 days before granting *any* foreign employee access to U.S. communications infrastructure or customer records.

This is a significant expansion. Team Telecom was designed to address foreign ownership and control — essentially, preventing foreign governments or entities from gaining influence over U.S. communications networks. Requiring advance DOJ approval for individual employee access decisions transforms it into an ongoing operational compliance regime that applies to routine business operations at companies with international workforces.

## The Compliance Burden

The [FCC's enforcement order](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2026/01/first-of-its-kind-enforcement-action-portends-fccs-expanded-national-security-role) attributed Marlink's violations to "inadequate screening procedures." The company's manual screening process failed to flag and vet 186 foreign employees who were granted access to infrastructure before receiving DOJ approval.

Consider what this requirement entails. A multinational telecommunications or satellite operator must:

1. Identify in advance every foreign employee who might need access to U.S. systems
2. Submit each name to the DOJ at least 30 days before granting access
3. Wait for DOJ approval (with no specified timeline for DOJ response)
4. Maintain documentation proving compliance for every access decision
5. Implement screening procedures robust enough to catch every potential violation

For companies operating global networks with international engineering teams, this creates significant operational friction. What happens when a foreign-national engineer needs emergency access to troubleshoot a network outage? What about routine system administration by overseas teams? Does every password reset or VPN credential require a 30-day DOJ waiting period?

The $175,000 fine for 186 violations works out to less than $1,000 per employee — a relatively modest penalty that suggests the FCC recognizes the compliance difficulty. But the [comprehensive compliance plan](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2026/01/fcc-enforces-team-telecom-mitigation-commitments-against-marlink) Marlink must now adopt — including enhanced procedures and ongoing reporting obligations — represents the real burden. Every telecom carrier with a Team Telecom mitigation agreement is now on notice that employee access decisions require the same level of scrutiny as foreign ownership structures.

## The CFIUS Parallel

This enforcement action mirrors a troubling pattern we've seen with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Created to review foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies for national security risks, CFIUS has steadily expanded its jurisdiction to cover software, data flows, and even minority investments in technology companies.

The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) gave CFIUS authority over "critical technologies" and access to "sensitive personal data" — vague categories that have enabled the committee to assert jurisdiction over transactions that involve no foreign control whatsoever. A Chinese venture capital firm taking a 5% stake in a U.S. healthcare startup can trigger a lengthy CFIUS review based solely on the theoretical possibility that patient data might be accessed.

Team Telecom is following the same trajectory. What began as foreign ownership review has evolved into granular oversight of which specific employees can access which specific systems. The logic is similar: if foreign ownership creates risk, then foreign employee access creates risk. But this reasoning proves too much. Taken to its logical conclusion, it would require government pre-approval for every foreign national working in any sensitive sector — a massive expansion of federal oversight into private sector hiring and operations.

## Arctic Frost and Political Weaponization

The February 10 Senate hearing adds crucial context. Senators are demanding answers about how AT&T, Verizon, and other carriers responded to [Jack Smith's subpoenas](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-demands-telecommunications-companies-federal-entities-turn-over-all-records-provided-to-jack-smith) requesting phone records for hundreds of Republican targets. The carriers provided heavily redacted responses to congressional oversight requests, prompting [formal subpoenas](https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2026/1/sen-johnson-subpoenas-at-t-verizon-and-lumen-for-records-identifying-targets-of-the-arctic-frost-investigation) from Senate investigators.

The juxtaposition is striking. The same federal government that demands telecommunications carriers cooperate fully with DOJ requests — on penalty of fines and enforcement actions — is now investigating those carriers for cooperating *too readily* with DOJ prosecutors. This puts telecom companies in an impossible position.

When the FCC fines a company for failing to seek DOJ approval before granting employee access, the implicit message is clear: defer to DOJ authority, implement extensive vetting procedures, prioritize national security compliance over operational efficiency. When senators subpoena carriers for complying with DOJ subpoenas, the message is equally clear: you cooperated too much with politically motivated investigations.

These competing pressures create a climate where telecom carriers can't win. Resist government information requests, and face enforcement actions. Comply with government information requests, and face congressional investigations. The result is regulatory uncertainty and political risk that falls heaviest on companies operating in the most scrutinized sectors.

## The Case for Risk-Based Screening

None of this is to say that foreign access to U.S. communications infrastructure poses no risk. China's telecommunications espionage is well-documented. The Salt Typhoon intrusions demonstrated that adversaries actively target telecom networks. Screening foreign employees for ties to hostile intelligence services is a legitimate security measure.

The problem is proportionality. Requiring DOJ pre-approval for every foreign employee creates compliance burden without corresponding security benefit. A Norwegian engineer troubleshooting satellite latency issues poses fundamentally different risks than a Chinese national with intelligence service connections accessing billing records. Treating both as equivalent security threats wastes regulatory resources and imposes unnecessary costs.

A better approach would implement risk-based screening tied to actual threat indicators:

**Country-specific restrictions**: Focus intensive vetting on employees from countries that pose documented espionage risks — China, Russia, Iran, North Korea. Employees from allied nations with strong rule of law could operate under lighter-touch screening.

**Access-level differentiation**: Distinguish between routine technical access (network monitoring, basic troubleshooting) and sensitive access (customer records, government communications, lawful intercept capabilities). Reserve the most stringent vetting for the highest-risk access.

**Post-hoc auditing over pre-approval**: Rather than requiring 30-day advance approval for every access decision, allow companies to grant access based on internal screening procedures, subject to regular DOJ audits verifying compliance. This shifts the burden from waiting for permission to demonstrating sound judgment.

**Clear threat standards**: Define what "national security risk" means in operational terms. Employees with current ties to foreign intelligence services? Prior violations of export control laws? Travel patterns suggesting foreign government direction? Vague references to foreign nationality don't provide useful guidance.

**Safe harbor for good-faith compliance**: Companies that implement robust screening procedures and cooperate with audits should receive protection from enforcement actions based on isolated violations. The Marlink case involved 186 employees — was this a systematic failure to comply, or a gap in an otherwise functional screening program? The enforcement action doesn't distinguish.

## Broader Implications

The Marlink enforcement action sets a precedent that extends beyond satellite operators. Any telecommunications carrier with foreign ownership — which includes most major international carriers — potentially faces similar mitigation agreements. The FCC's description of this as a ["landmark" enforcement action](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/fcc-enforcement-action-violating-team-telecom-committments.html) signals that this represents a new enforcement priority.

Legal observers note that this action [portends the FCC's expanded national security role](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2026/01/first-of-its-kind-enforcement-action-portends-fccs-expanded-national-security-role). The agency has traditionally focused on spectrum allocation, licensing, and technical standards. Team Telecom enforcement pulls the FCC into operational oversight that looks more like counterintelligence than telecommunications regulation.

This creates several concerns:

**Institutional competence**: Does the FCC have the expertise to assess individual employee security risks? That's traditionally been FBI and DHS territory. Using FCC enforcement mechanisms to implement Team Telecom mitigation agreements blurs the line between technical regulation and national security vetting.

**Regulatory overlap**: Companies in the telecommunications and information and communications technology services (ICTS) sectors already face CFIUS review, ICTS executive order compliance, export control requirements, and various sector-specific security mandates. Adding Team Telecom employee vetting to this stack creates cumulative burden that few companies can navigate efficiently.

**Chilling effect on international operations**: If U.S. telecommunications licensing requires extensive vetting of all foreign employees, companies may simply avoid the U.S. market or structure operations to minimize foreign employee involvement. This could disadvantage U.S. carriers in competition with international rivals who don't face equivalent restrictions.

**Due process concerns**: What standards apply to DOJ decisions about employee access? Can denied employees appeal? What evidence can be used to justify denial? The process appears to vest substantial discretion in DOJ without clear procedural protections.

## Conclusion

Team Telecom serves a legitimate purpose. Foreign ownership and control of U.S. communications infrastructure does pose national security risks that justify regulatory oversight. But the Marlink enforcement action reveals how a foreign ownership review mechanism has metastasized into day-to-day operational micromanagement.

Requiring DOJ pre-approval for 186 foreign employees to access satellite systems is not targeted national security screening. It's an intrusive compliance regime that imposes costs and delays on routine business operations without clear evidence that such granular oversight actually improves security outcomes.

As telecommunications carriers navigate the competing pressures illustrated by the Arctic Frost controversy — pressure to cooperate fully with federal authorities on one hand, and political backlash for that same cooperation on the other — policymakers should ask whether we're building a sustainable regulatory framework or simply expanding bureaucratic authority.

The upcoming February 10 hearing will reveal whether senators recognize this tension or simply add another layer of political pressure to an already over-regulated sector. The better path forward would be moving toward risk-based screening that focuses resources on actual threats rather than treating every foreign employee as a potential security risk. National security oversight should be targeted, proportionate, and based on actual threat indicators — not blanket restrictions that assume guilt by nationality.
