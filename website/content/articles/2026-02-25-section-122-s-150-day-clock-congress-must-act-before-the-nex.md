summary: "Five days after the Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling in Learning Resources v. Trump struck down IEEPA tariffs, the administration pivoted to a 15% global surcharge under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 — a 150-day emergency authority that expires in late July. For the tech sector, the SCOTUS ruling changed less than headlines suggest, and the Section 122 clock is now Congress's best opportunity in years to assert durable trade authority."

# Section 122's 150-Day Clock: Congress Must Act Before the Next Tariff Emergency

Last Friday, the Supreme Court handed down a landmark check on executive power. By Monday morning, the White House had already found a workaround. Congress now has 145 days to decide whether it will govern, or whether the United States will continue to lurch from one emergency tariff authority to the next — with the tech sector absorbing the shocks each time.

## What the SCOTUS Ruling Actually Did — and Didn't Do

The Court's [6-3 ruling in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf) on February 20 was significant but narrower than much of the coverage suggested. Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, held that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act simply does not authorize the President to impose tariffs — the statute's "lengthy list of powers" conspicuously omits the word. That omission was dispositive.

Critically for tech policy observers: the ruling has [no effect on tariffs imposed under Section 232](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-ruling-industry-higher-rates.html) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 or Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The 25% Section 232 tariff on advanced AI semiconductors — including the NVIDIA H200 and AMD MI325X — [imposed by Presidential Proclamation 11002 in January](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/adjusting-imports-of-semiconductors-semiconductor-manufacturing-equipment-and-their-derivative-products-into-the-united-states/) remains fully intact. The tech sector did not get a SCOTUS reprieve; it got a different set of pressures.

One doctrinal note worth flagging: [portions of Roberts's opinion invoking the Major Questions Doctrine](https://www.scotusblog.com/2026/02/a-breakdown-of-the-courts-tariff-decision/) — requiring "clear congressional authorization" for extraordinary executive actions — were joined only by Justices Gorsuch and Barrett, making those sections a three-justice plurality rather than a majority holding. Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson agreed with the outcome on narrower statutory grounds and explicitly rejected the MQD framing. The structural principle is sound — but practitioners should not overstate what the plurality opinion establishes as binding doctrine.

## The Section 122 Pivot: A New Layer of Pressure

Within hours of the ruling, the administration [invoked Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-a-temporary-import-duty-to-address-fundamental-international-payment-problems/) to impose a 10% global import surcharge, escalated to the [statutory maximum of 15% by February 24](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/24/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-section-122). The authority — [invoked for the first time in U.S. history](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-23/all-about-section-122-trump-s-new-go-to-tariff-provision) — permits emergency tariff action to address "large and serious" balance-of-payments deficits for up to 150 days, expiring around July 24, 2026 without congressional renewal.

For the tech sector, the 15% surcharge lands on compute hardware, consumer electronics, and components not already covered by the Section 232 semiconductor proclamation. The [Yale Budget Lab estimates](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-tariffs-february-21-2026) that the current tariff regime — if Section 122 is extended — implies a consumer price increase equivalent to roughly $1,300 per household. That is before accounting for any Phase 2 semiconductor escalation.

## The AI Infrastructure Squeeze

The compounding effect on AI infrastructure deserves particular attention. The [25% Section 232 tariff on advanced chips](https://www.thompsonhinesmartrade.com/2026/01/president-trump-implements-temporary-import-duties-under-section-122-of-the-trade-act-of-1974-and-continues-the-suspension-of-duty-free-de-minimis-exception-for-international-shipments/) has already restructured procurement decisions across the hyperscaler market. Tesla disclosed in its [Q4 2025 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2026/01/28/tesla-tsla-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/) that tariff impacts exceeded $500 million in a single quarter — and that the company is seriously evaluating building proprietary domestic chip fabrication to escape supply-chain uncertainty.

That calculation — build your own fab to reduce exposure to policy unpredictability — is the innovation tax that blunt-instrument tariffs impose. Capital that could fund model development, infrastructure deployment, or workforce training is instead being channeled into supply-chain hedging.

The uncertainty compounds. [Commerce's 90-day Section 232 review period](https://www.gibsondunn.com/trump-administration-new-tariffs-on-and-export-licensing-requirements-for-advanced-semiconductors-create-challenging-new-cross-currents-new-opportunities-for-us-manufacturers/) — which could trigger broader semiconductor tariffs of up to 100% for manufacturers not investing domestically — expires in mid-April. A [July 1 update](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/trump-advanced-ai-semiconductors-actions.html) could modify the tariff landscape again. Companies trying to plan multi-year AI infrastructure investments are navigating a policy environment that changes quarterly.

The United States cannot win the AI race while taxing the inputs required to run it.

## The 150-Day Window Is a Congressional Opportunity

Section 122's sunset is not a bug — it's a feature. Congress built a forcing mechanism into the statute precisely because emergency trade authority should be temporary. The question is whether the legislative branch will use the next 145 days to govern, or simply let the clock run while waiting to see whether the administration invokes yet another emergency authority after expiration.

[As the Peterson Institute has noted](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2026/what-supreme-courts-tariff-ruling-changes-and-what-it-doesnt), the SCOTUS ruling creates a genuine opening for Congress to reassert its constitutional trade authority — not by eliminating trade enforcement, but by establishing durable, predictable statutory frameworks. Senate Finance and House Ways and Means have specific options.

**First**, pass targeted carveouts for AI hardware, advanced semiconductors, and compute infrastructure that are not manufactured domestically at scale. The Section 232 data center exemption is a model worth extending and codifying.

**Second**, establish clear Section 301 parameters for adversarial-actor trade enforcement — particularly China — that do not require recycling emergency authority and give industry the certainty needed to make 10-year investment decisions.

**Third**, use the Section 122 expiration as a forcing function for comprehensive trade legislation, not an occasion to silently ratify emergency-authority cycling. The President could theoretically allow Section 122 to lapse, declare a new emergency, and restart the 150-day clock indefinitely — [a loophole trade experts have already flagged](https://globaltradealert.org/blog/from-ieepa-to-section-122). Congress should close it.

## What Smart Trade Policy Looks Like

There is a legitimate national security case for semiconductor supply-chain resilience. The [CHIPS and Science Act](https://www.commerce.gov/chips) demonstrated that domestic investment incentives — not import taxes — are the right instrument for building that resilience. A 25% tariff on NVIDIA H200s does not build a domestic fab; it raises the cost of training the next generation of American AI models.

The administration's instinct to protect strategic industries from adversarial dependency is sound. The execution — a cascade of overlapping emergency authorities applied to global supply chains — is not. Section 232 national security tariffs for narrowly defined strategic goods are defensible. A 15% blanket global surcharge imposed under a balance-of-payments statute, on a day when [trade economists across the political spectrum question whether the legal predicate even exists](https://fortune.com/2026/02/21/trump-tariffs-section-122-trade-law-trade-deficit-capital-account-surplus-balance-of-payments/), is a different instrument entirely.

The Supreme Court, in its statutory holding, affirmed a core principle: extraordinary economic power requires clear congressional authorization. Congress should take that seriously and use the 150-day clock to deliver exactly that — not just for this administration, but for every one that follows.

The alternative is permanent governance by emergency, with the tech sector perpetually repriced at the whim of a 150-day countdown.
