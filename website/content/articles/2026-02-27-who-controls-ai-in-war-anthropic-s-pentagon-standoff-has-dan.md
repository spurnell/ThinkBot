summary: "When Anthropic's CEO publicly declared the company would refuse DoD contracts permitting autonomous weapons or domestic mass surveillance, it crossed a line — from corporate responsibility into national security policy-making by private fiat. The right venue for these guardrails is Congress and the Pentagon, not a press release from San Francisco."

# Who Controls AI in War? Anthropic's Pentagon Standoff Has Dangerous Implications

When Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei publicly declared this week that his company would refuse Department of Defense contracts permitting the use of Claude for domestic mass surveillance or autonomous weapons, he framed it as an act of corporate responsibility. He may have intended it that way. But the effect is something far more consequential: a private AI developer unilaterally setting the terms of American military capability — not through quiet contractual negotiation, but through a public ultimatum aimed at the Pentagon.

That is not corporate responsibility. That is governance by press release.

## The Distinction That Matters

No serious person argues that AI companies should have zero discretion over their products' use. Companies set terms of service. They decline customers. They make ethical commitments. This is normal and appropriate. Anthropic — like every major AI lab — has both the legal right and the ethical obligation to think carefully about how its systems are deployed.

But there is a vast difference between declining a specific contract and issuing a public declaration that conditions national security cooperation on a private company's own definitions of contested military concepts. "Autonomous weapons" and "domestic mass surveillance" are not self-defining terms. They are contested, evolving categories about which military lawyers, ethicists, arms control experts, and legislators have argued for decades. When a lab CEO announces that his company's interpretation of those terms will govern what the U.S. military may and may not do with frontier AI, he is not exercising responsible stewardship. He is substituting private judgment for democratic accountability.

The [Department of Defense AI Ethics Principles](https://www.ai.mil/docs/Principles_of_AI_Final_10-31-23.pdf), adopted in 2020 and refined through subsequent implementation guidance, already establish a serious federal framework for responsible military AI — one developed through years of deliberation by legal, ethical, and operational experts with actual accountability to the American public. Congress has not delegated to private firms the authority to supersede or supplement that framework with their own ad hoc definitions. No company headquarters holds such a mandate.

## The Strategic Gap Problem

The governance-by-press-release problem would be concerning in isolation. In the current strategic environment, it is alarming.

China's AI development ecosystem operates under no equivalent constraints. The People's Liberation Army integrates commercial AI capabilities into military applications with state coordination and no corporate veto. When U.S. AI labs impose unilateral restrictions on defense work — restrictions defined by their own leadership rather than by law or treaty — they widen the capability gap that adversaries face no obligation to match.

This is not an argument that the U.S. military should face zero ethical constraints on AI deployment. It is an argument that those constraints must be set through legitimate, accountable, and strategically coherent processes — not ad hoc corporate rule-setting that shifts with leadership priorities, investor pressure, or the news cycle. A private company's ethical commitments, however sincere, are not a durable basis for national security policy. They can change with a new CEO, a new funding round, or a new board.

The [January 2025 AI Executive Order](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/new-executive-order-national-policy-framework-artificial-intelligence.html) explicitly emphasized federal coordination of AI governance — a recognition at the highest levels of government that fragmented, ad hoc approaches create strategic and legal incoherence. Anthropic's public ultimatum is precisely the kind of fragmentation that federal coordination is meant to prevent.

## The Policy Vacuum Is the Real Problem

To be fair to Anthropic — and the framing here matters — this episode is a symptom, not the disease. The real problem is the yawning policy vacuum that has left AI companies with no clear federal framework governing defense AI procurement, contractor obligations, or use-case definitions. When Congress fails to legislate and the executive branch fails to codify, private actors fill the void with their own rules. That is what is happening here.

As [federal AI governance efforts](https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/54731/2025-12-18-federal-takeover-ai-governance-breaking-down-white) have struggled to cohere into durable law, the regulatory space has remained contested and unclear. Courts are increasingly being asked to weigh in on AI accountability questions that legislators have declined to resolve. And AI labs — finding themselves in possession of transformative capabilities with no clear rules of the road — are making policy by default.

This is no way to govern a strategic technology. The answer is not to celebrate corporate self-regulation as a substitute for governance. The answer is to build the governance infrastructure that makes ad hoc corporate policy-making unnecessary.

## What the Right Framework Looks Like

Congress should legislate clear boundaries for military AI procurement — defining, with appropriate expert input, what autonomous weapons systems are, what oversight requirements apply, and what use cases require additional legal authority. The DoD should formalize its AI ethics implementation into binding procurement requirements with teeth, not just aspirational principles. And the executive branch should establish clear channels for AI labs to raise ethical concerns about government contracts — channels that feed into policy processes, not press releases.

The [FTC's limited preemption authority over AI](https://www.techpolicy.press/the-ftcs-ai-preemption-authority-is-limited/) is a reminder that no single existing agency has the mandate or the tools to govern defense AI comprehensively. This requires deliberate federal action — coordinated across DoD, the intelligence community, and Congress — not piecemeal responses to whatever a given lab CEO decides to announce this week.

None of this requires abandoning ethical constraints on military AI. The DoD framework, whatever its imperfections, is the right venue for those constraints precisely because it is subject to democratic accountability, legal review, and the kind of institutional continuity that a press release from a tech executive can never provide.

## The Precedent Is the Problem

Whatever one thinks of Anthropic's specific positions on autonomous weapons or surveillance — and reasonable people disagree sharply on both — the precedent set by this episode is dangerous. If the norm becomes that major AI labs will publicly condition defense cooperation on their own definitional judgments about contested military-ethical questions, the United States will face a future in which its most capable AI systems are governed by a patchwork of corporate policies with no democratic legitimacy and no strategic coherence.

America's AI leadership is a genuine strategic asset. Squandering it through a governance vacuum that pushes AI labs into making foreign and defense policy by press release serves no one — not the companies, not the military, and not the public.

The fix is federal governance. Build it now, before the next press release shapes the next policy.
