summary: "President Trump's executive order proposing federal preemption of state AI laws is directionally correct. A patchwork of 100 laws across 38 states creates compliance chaos that punishes startups, entrenches incumbents, and does little to address genuine AI risks. The right answer is a uniform national framework — but only if that framework stays light-touch, sector-specific, and grounded in voluntary standards."

# The Right Call: Why Federal AI Preemption Beats a 50-State Patchwork

## The Problem No One Can Afford to Ignore

On December 11, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order titled "Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence." The order does something that few policy interventions manage: it identifies a genuine structural problem and proposes a structurally sound response. At its core, the order asserts federal preemption over the fast-growing thicket of state-level AI regulation. It directs the Commerce Department to publish an evaluation by March 11, 2026, identifying state laws that impose burdens on the development and deployment of AI systems. It establishes an AI Litigation Task Force charged with challenging state AI statutes in court. And it leverages federal broadband funding under the BEAD program to press states toward regulatory alignment.

These are aggressive mechanisms. But the underlying diagnosis is correct. In 2025 alone, 38 states adopted roughly 100 AI-related laws. Colorado passed a sweeping AI Act — then promptly postponed its effective date to June 2026 after industry and civil-society groups alike warned the law was unworkable. The state-level regulatory landscape for artificial intelligence has become precisely the kind of fragmented, contradictory, and unpredictable environment that throttles innovation, rewards incumbents, and fails to protect anyone. Federal preemption is the right structural answer. The question is what replaces the patchwork — and whether Washington can resist the temptation to build a federal bureaucratic maze in its place.

## One Hundred Laws, Fifty Jurisdictions, Zero Coherence

The sheer scale of state AI legislative activity in 2025 should alarm anyone who cares about the competitiveness of the American technology sector. Consider what a mid-stage AI startup faces today. A company building a hiring-assistance tool must navigate Colorado's AI Act, which requires algorithmic impact assessments for any "high-risk" automated decision system. It must account for Illinois's Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, which governs the use of AI in analyzing video interviews. It must consider New York City's Local Law 144, which mandates annual bias audits for automated employment decision tools. It must track California's proposed regulations on generative AI disclosure and Texas's evolving rules on AI in insurance underwriting. And it must do all of this while the laws themselves remain in flux — Colorado's postponement is only the most visible example of statutes being passed, paused, amended, or reinterpreted in real time.

This is not a theoretical burden. Compliance with a single jurisdiction's AI regulations can cost a small company between $200,000 and $500,000 annually when accounting for legal review, technical auditing, documentation requirements, and ongoing monitoring obligations. Multiply that across a dozen or more states with materially different requirements, and the math becomes prohibitive for any company that is not already large and well-capitalized. The result is a regulatory environment that functions, whether intentionally or not, as a moat protecting incumbents.

Large technology companies can absorb these costs. They have in-house legal departments, dedicated compliance teams, and the resources to engage with regulators in every state capital. A five-person startup building a novel AI application cannot. When regulatory compliance consumes a quarter of a young company's operating budget, the company does not become safer or more responsible. It either relocates, pivots away from AI, or shuts down. The consumers and workers that state laws purport to protect are not made better off. They simply have fewer choices and less competition in the market.

## The Laboratories-of-Democracy Argument — and Its Limits

The strongest objection to federal preemption is the Brandeisian one: that states serve as "laboratories of democracy," experimenting with different regulatory approaches so that the nation can learn what works. This argument has genuine force in many policy domains. Criminal justice reform, healthcare coverage, environmental regulation — all have benefited from state-level experimentation that eventually informed federal action.

But the argument has meaningful limits when applied to a technology that is global in scope, that changes faster than any legislature can track, and whose products cross state lines with every API call. When a large language model processes a query, it does not stop at the Colorado border. When an AI-powered diagnostic tool analyzes a medical image, the algorithm is the same whether the patient is in Austin or Albany. The nature of the technology resists jurisdictional fragmentation in a way that, say, zoning policy or minimum-wage law does not.

There is also an honest reckoning to be had about the quality of state-level AI legislation produced to date. Much of it has been drafted without deep technical understanding of how AI systems actually work. Definitions of key terms — "automated decision system," "high-risk AI," "algorithmic discrimination" — vary wildly from state to state, sometimes in ways that are mutually contradictory. Some laws impose prescriptive process requirements (mandatory bias audits, impact assessments, disclosure notices) without evidence that these processes actually reduce harm. Others are so vaguely drafted that compliance is effectively indeterminate — companies cannot know with confidence whether they are in violation until they are sued.

This is not to say that every state AI law is misguided, or that no state legislator has engaged seriously with the underlying policy questions. Some states have produced thoughtful, narrowly tailored rules addressing specific, well-defined harms. But the aggregate effect of 100 laws across 38 states is not thoughtful experimentation. It is regulatory noise. And in a domain where speed of development and deployment is a key determinant of global competitiveness — particularly vis-a-vis China — regulatory noise carries a real cost that extends beyond any single firm's compliance budget.

## Federal Preemption Is the Right Structure

The case for federal preemption rests on a straightforward principle: when a technology is inherently national and global in its operation and impact, the regulatory framework should be national. This is not a novel proposition. Federal preemption governs telecommunications, aviation safety, nuclear energy, and interstate commerce more broadly. In each of these domains, the federal government established a uniform national standard not to suppress state authority for its own sake, but because the alternative — fifty different sets of rules for a single interconnected system — was untenable.

Artificial intelligence fits squarely within this logic. AI models are trained on data that crosses every state boundary. They are deployed via cloud infrastructure that is geographically indifferent. Their outputs affect consumers, workers, patients, and citizens in every jurisdiction simultaneously. A single, clear national framework allows developers to build once and deploy everywhere, with confidence about what the rules are. A fifty-state patchwork forces developers to build fifty times — or, more realistically, to build for the most restrictive jurisdiction and impose that jurisdiction's policy preferences on the entire nation by default.

This last point deserves emphasis. In the absence of federal preemption, the most aggressive state regulator effectively sets national policy. This is the "California effect" that has long shaped environmental and consumer-protection standards. Whether or not one approves of that dynamic in other domains, it is a poor way to govern a technology whose trajectory is genuinely uncertain and whose societal implications are still being understood. It substitutes the policy preferences of a single state legislature for a deliberate national conversation about where the line between innovation and regulation should be drawn.

## Addressing the "Deregulation for Big Tech" Critique

Critics of the executive order have argued that federal preemption is a vehicle for deregulation that primarily benefits large technology companies. This framing gets the incentives exactly backward.

Large AI companies are the primary beneficiaries of the status quo. They are the ones with the resources to navigate a fifty-state compliance landscape. Every additional state regulation raises the barrier to entry and widens the gap between incumbents and challengers. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta can staff a compliance department in every state capital. A startup building a competing AI product from a coworking space in Pittsburgh cannot.

Federal preemption, properly executed, levels the playing field. A single national standard means that a small company faces the same regulatory requirements as a large one — and only one set of them. The compliance burden becomes proportional rather than multiplicative. This is the most pro-competitive, pro-startup outcome available.

The objection also misreads the political economy of AI regulation. Many state AI laws have been shaped by lobbying from incumbent technology firms that have the sophistication to ensure new regulations align with their existing compliance infrastructure. When a state mandates a specific auditing methodology, or requires a particular form of documentation, or defines "high-risk AI" in a way that maps neatly onto the categories a major platform already uses, the regulation functions less as consumer protection and more as competitive insulation. A uniform federal standard, developed transparently and with broad input, is less susceptible to this kind of regulatory capture than fifty separate state-level processes.

## The EO's Mechanisms: Aggressive but Warranted

The executive order's specific enforcement mechanisms — the AI Litigation Task Force, the leverage of BEAD broadband funding, the Commerce Department evaluation — have drawn criticism for being heavy-handed. There is some validity to this concern. Using federal infrastructure funding as a lever to influence state regulatory policy raises legitimate federalism questions. Establishing a task force whose explicit purpose is to litigate against state laws is an unusual and assertive posture.

But the urgency of the situation warrants assertive action. The pace of state AI legislation is accelerating, not slowing. If the federal government signals passivity, the patchwork will grow from 100 laws to 200 within two years. Every month of delay means another state statute that creates another compliance obligation, another legal ambiguity, and another reason for a rational entrepreneur to build something other than an AI company. The window for establishing a coherent national framework is finite, and it is narrowing.

The Commerce Department evaluation, in particular, is a sensible first step. By March 2026, the government will have a systematic accounting of which state laws impose material burdens on AI development and deployment. This evidence base can inform not only preemption decisions but also the design of the federal framework that preemption creates space for. Governance should be grounded in evidence, and this process at least gestures in that direction.

## What the Federal Framework Should Look Like

Federal preemption is a necessary condition for a rational AI regulatory environment. It is not a sufficient one. Replacing fifty burdensome state regimes with a single burdensome federal regime would be worse than the status quo, because it would eliminate even the theoretical possibility of a more permissive jurisdiction. The federal framework that follows preemption must be designed with restraint, clarity, and a bias toward enabling innovation.

ThinkBot recommends five principles for the federal framework.

**First, it should be sector-specific rather than horizontal.** The risks of AI in healthcare are different from the risks of AI in financial services, which are different from the risks of AI in content moderation. A single omnibus AI law that attempts to govern all applications with the same set of rules will inevitably be either too restrictive for low-risk applications or too permissive for high-risk ones. Sector-specific regulation, layered on top of existing sectoral regulators (FDA, SEC, NHTSA, and others), allows for calibrated responses to distinct risk profiles.

**Second, it should be outcomes-based rather than process-prescriptive.** Mandating specific auditing methodologies, documentation formats, or technical standards locks in current best practices and prevents the development of better ones. The framework should define what outcomes are unacceptable — discriminatory lending decisions, unsafe autonomous vehicle behavior, misdiagnosis in medical imaging — and hold developers accountable for results, not paperwork.

**Third, it should rely heavily on voluntary standards developed through NIST.** The National Institute of Standards and Technology has a decades-long track record of developing consensus technical standards in collaboration with industry, academia, and civil society. The NIST AI Risk Management Framework, published in 2023, provides a strong foundation. Voluntary, regularly updated standards are more adaptable to a fast-moving technology than statutory mandates that take years to amend.

**Fourth, it should include a clear safe harbor for companies that comply with federal standards.** One of the most damaging features of the current environment is legal uncertainty. Companies that make good-faith efforts to develop and deploy AI responsibly still face unpredictable litigation risk across multiple jurisdictions. A federal safe harbor — compliance with the federal framework provides a defense against state-level claims — gives developers the confidence to invest and ship.

**Fifth, it should preserve a meaningful role for enforcement against genuine harms.** Preemption should not mean impunity. The federal framework must include mechanisms for identifying and penalizing companies that deploy AI systems causing demonstrable harm. The Federal Trade Commission, sector-specific regulators, and the Department of Justice all have existing authority that can be brought to bear. The point is not to eliminate accountability but to make it uniform, predictable, and proportionate.

## The Stakes

The United States leads the world in AI development. That lead is not guaranteed. China is investing aggressively in AI capabilities and operating under a regulatory framework that, whatever its other deficiencies, does not impose fifty competing sets of rules on its domestic technology sector. The European Union's AI Act, for all its flaws, at least provides a single regulatory standard across its member states. If the United States uniquely saddles its AI industry with a fragmented, unpredictable, and multiplicatively burdensome compliance environment, the consequences for American competitiveness will be real and lasting.

The executive order signed on December 11 is not a perfect document. Its mechanisms are aggressive, and reasonable people can debate whether every element of the approach is well-calibrated. But its core insight — that a fifty-state patchwork of AI regulation is unsustainable, and that federal preemption is the structural answer — is correct. The task now is to ensure that the federal framework built in the preemption's wake embodies the right values: regulatory clarity over bureaucratic complexity, outcomes over process, and a genuine commitment to keeping the United States at the frontier of the most consequential technology of our time.

The choice is not between regulation and no regulation. It is between one clear set of rules and fifty conflicting ones. For startups, for consumers, for American competitiveness, and for the responsible development of artificial intelligence, one is better than fifty. That is the case for federal preemption — and it is the right call.
