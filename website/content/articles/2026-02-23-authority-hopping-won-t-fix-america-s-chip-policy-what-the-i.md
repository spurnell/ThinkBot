summary: "The Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling striking down IEEPA tariffs was a correct constitutional correction — but the administration's immediate pivot to a 15% global surcharge under Section 122 simply replaces one blunt emergency instrument with another. What U.S. tech leadership needs is a stable, congressionally-authorized semiconductor trade framework, not cascading executive workarounds."

At midnight tonight, a new 15% global import surcharge takes effect — and the U.S. semiconductor supply chain wakes up to yet another morning of policy-induced uncertainty. Yesterday, the Supreme Court handed down a 6-3 ruling in [*Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf) striking down the administration's IEEPA-based tariffs as an unconstitutional delegation of trade authority to the executive branch. Within hours, the White House pivoted to a 15% global surcharge under Section 122 of the Trade Act, effective February 24. [Section 232 semiconductor tariffs remain fully intact](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-ruling-industry-higher-rates.html).

The Court got it right. Congress cannot allow the executive to levy taxes — and make no mistake, that is what tariffs are — through emergency powers. But America's chip industry, its AI developers, and the investors funding the next generation of compute infrastructure need more than a constitutional correction. They need Congress to build the durable, targeted trade framework that emergency statutes were never designed to provide.

## The Court Did Its Job. Now Congress Must Do Its Job.

The IEEPA ruling is a victory for separation of powers, not a defeat for smart semiconductor policy. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act was designed for targeted financial sanctions in genuine foreign policy crises — not as a general-purpose tariff engine. When the administration used it to impose sweeping import levies, it stretched the statute well past its textual limits, and the Court correctly said so.

[Legal analysts at Perkins Coie](https://perkinscoie.com/insights/update/supreme-court-holds-ieepa-tariffs-unlawful-president-trump-terminates-and-partially) noted that the ruling reaffirms the nondelegation principle: Congress cannot hand the executive a blank check to tax the economy in the name of emergency. That principle matters enormously for business planning. Semiconductor fabs cost $20 billion or more to build. Advanced packaging facilities require decade-long capital commitments. No CFO can authorize that spending when the tariff environment can shift by executive decree and be reversed by judicial ruling — all within a news cycle.

The administration's response to the ruling illustrates exactly why the ruling alone is insufficient. Rather than accepting the Court's rebuke and working with Congress on a legitimate framework, the White House [pivoted within hours](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2026-2-23-trump-defies-supreme-court-with-15-global-tariff-a-high-stakes-legal-gambit) to Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 — a provision authorizing temporary import surcharges for up to 150 days to address balance-of-payments emergencies. One statute gets struck down; another gets pressed into service. This is authority-hopping, and it is a governance pattern as damaging as the underlying tariffs themselves.

## Section 122 Replaces One Problem With Another

Section 122 was designed for a narrow purpose: addressing acute balance-of-payments crises. Applying it as a substitute for comprehensive trade policy strains its statutory authority and invites the next round of litigation. Emergency-power stacking — sequentially invoking whatever authority hasn't yet been struck down — is not a legal strategy. It signals to the courts, to trading partners, and to global capital markets that the United States lacks a coherent, stable trade doctrine.

For the technology sector, this matters immediately. A 15% global surcharge hits components, equipment, and intermediate goods that U.S. manufacturers and AI developers depend on today — while the domestic capacity the CHIPS Act is funding won't reach full production for years. In the interim, U.S. AI companies, cloud providers, and device manufacturers absorb higher input costs with no competitive offset. [The Tax Foundation estimates](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/) that broad tariff regimes of this magnitude function as significant taxes on domestic producers as much as on foreign exporters.

Meanwhile, the 150-day clock on Section 122 means the surcharge will expire — or face extension — in late summer 2026. Businesses that adjusted supply chains for the new regime will face another round of uncertainty. The volatility is the policy.

## Section 232 Is the Unresolved Core Problem

Lost in the IEEPA drama is a harder truth: [Section 232 semiconductor tariffs survived the ruling entirely](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-ruling-industry-higher-rates.html). These levies — justified on national security grounds — continue to tax advanced node imports, chip packaging, and AI compute hardware that U.S. hyperscalers cannot yet source domestically at scale.

The innovation cost is direct and compounding. Higher compute costs raise the price of AI training runs, compress margins for U.S. AI developers competing against Chinese labs, and slow data center buildout at precisely the moment the United States is trying to establish durable infrastructure advantages. National security is a legitimate policy goal — but emergency tariffs that persist indefinitely, outside the normal legislative process, are the wrong instrument for achieving it.

## The CHIPS Act Shows the Right Model

The right alternative already exists. The [CHIPS and Science Act](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2026/02/supreme-court-strikes-down-ieepa-tariffs) passed with bipartisan support because Congress recognized that semiconductor leadership requires targeted, legislatively-grounded industrial policy. Its investments in domestic fabrication, R&D, and workforce development provide the policy certainty that attracts multi-decade capital commitments.

That model — specific, authorized by Congress, bounded in scope, reviewable — should govern trade tools as well. If the national security case for semiconductor tariffs is real, Congress should legislate it explicitly: define the sectors covered, set the rates, establish review mechanisms, and tie phase-outs to domestic production milestones. This gives industry a planning horizon, gives courts a clear statutory basis, and gives trading partners — including allies whose cooperation we need for supply chain diversification — a negotiating counterpart rather than a revolving door of emergency actions.

## What Congress Must Do Now

The IEEPA ruling hands Congress both an obligation and an opportunity. The obligation: clarify and bound executive trade authority so that authority-hopping cannot continue. The opportunity: build the durable semiconductor trade framework that 150-day emergency statutes cannot provide.

Concretely, that means three things. First, pass explicit statutory authority — with defined scope and sunset provisions — for any semiconductor-specific measures justified on national security grounds. Second, tie trade policy to the CHIPS Act framework: tariff relief should scale with domestic production milestones, rewarding investment rather than simply taxing imports indefinitely. Third, engage allied democracies — Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, the EU — in plurilateral supply chain agreements that reduce dependence on adversary-controlled nodes without triggering the retaliatory spirals that unilateral emergency tariffs invite.

The United States is not losing the semiconductor race because it lacks emergency tariff authority. It is winning — slowly, expensively — because of the patient, legislatively-grounded investments the CHIPS Act catalyzed. The Court did its part yesterday. The question is whether Congress will do its part before the next emergency workaround lands in federal court.
