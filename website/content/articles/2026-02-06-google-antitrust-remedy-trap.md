summary: "The government's push for aggressive structural remedies in the Google search case is fighting the last war. Generative AI is already disrupting search more effectively than any court order could. Policymakers should redirect their antitrust energy toward ensuring competition in the AI stack rather than dismantling yesterday's monopoly."

## Fighting the Last War

The Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general are now appealing portions of the Google search antitrust ruling, demanding remedies more aggressive than what the court initially entertained. Forced divestiture of Chrome. A blanket ban on default search agreements. Structural separation that would reshape how hundreds of millions of Americans access information online.

There is just one problem: the market these remedies are designed to fix is already being disrupted — not by government lawyers, but by technology itself.

While regulators spent years litigating whether Google's default search agreements constituted an illegal monopoly, ChatGPT amassed over 200 million weekly active users. Perplexity carved out a fast-growing niche in AI-powered research. Google's own Gemini began cannibalizing its traditional search product. And a generation of users started discovering information in ways that make the ten-blue-links paradigm feel as dated as the Yellow Pages.

The court found that Google violated antitrust law. That finding stands, and it should not be minimized. But the question of liability is distinct from the question of remedy. And on remedy, the government coalition is making a serious error: it is prescribing surgery for a condition the market is already curing.

## The Remedy Mismatch

Consider the flagship proposals. Forcing Google to divest Chrome would unwind a browser used by roughly three billion people worldwide — not because Chrome itself is anticompetitive, but because it serves as a distribution channel for Google Search. Banning default search agreements would prohibit Google from paying Apple, Samsung, and Mozilla to pre-install its search engine, deals that currently fund billions of dollars in browser development and device subsidies that flow directly to consumers.

These remedies target a specific theory of harm: that Google locked up distribution channels so effectively that no rival search engine could reach users. Five years ago, that theory had real force. Today, it collides with an obvious fact: consumers are voluntarily adopting AI alternatives at a pace that dwarfs anything the antitrust enforcement apparatus could engineer.

No court order forced users to download ChatGPT. No consent decree drove Perplexity's growth. No structural remedy convinced Microsoft to pour billions into OpenAI and rebuild Bing around conversational AI. The market did what antitrust enforcers hoped to do — it created meaningful alternatives and put them in users' hands. The difference is that the market did it in two years, while the litigation has dragged on for five.

## The Consumer Welfare Question

Strip away the legal abstractions, and antitrust law is supposed to answer a simple question: are consumers being harmed?

Under the consumer welfare standard that has guided American antitrust for decades, the answer is increasingly difficult to sustain. Google's default agreements give users a search product that is, by the government's own implicit admission, good enough that it takes a court order to dislodge. Meanwhile, consumers who want AI-powered alternatives face no meaningful switching costs. Downloading ChatGPT or Perplexity takes seconds. Changing a browser's default search engine takes a few clicks.

The government's theory requires believing that consumers are so inert, so incapable of making choices, that they need federal intervention to discover alternatives — even as those same consumers are voluntarily adopting new AI tools at historic rates. The theory contradicts its own evidence.

Aggressive structural remedies carry real costs. Divesting Chrome would disrupt a product that billions rely on daily, with no guarantee that the successor entity would maintain the same level of investment and security. Banning default agreements would eliminate revenue streams that subsidize free browsers and reduce device costs. These are not hypothetical harms. They are predictable consequences that would land on consumers while the supposed benefits chase a monopoly that is already eroding.

## Where Antitrust Should Actually Look

None of this means antitrust enforcement in tech should stand down. It means enforcement should aim at the right target.

The real competition bottleneck in 2026 is not search distribution — it is the AI stack. Training frontier models requires massive compute resources concentrated among a handful of cloud providers. Access to high-quality training data is increasingly gated by licensing agreements that favor incumbents. The scarce supply of advanced AI chips creates dependencies that dwarf anything Google's search agreements ever produced.

If policymakers are serious about competition in the AI era, they should be scrutinizing compute market concentration, ensuring open access to publicly funded research data, and preventing the emerging AI giants from pulling up the ladder behind them. They should be asking whether exclusive cloud-compute partnerships between model developers and hyperscalers risk creating the next generation of locked-in distribution — the very dynamic they claim to oppose in the search context.

This is where the real antitrust action is. The Google search case, whatever its merits at the liability stage, is a rearview mirror. The AI competition landscape is the windshield.

## The Error Cost Asymmetry

Antitrust remedies are not free. They impose costs — on companies, consumers, and the innovation ecosystem. When those remedies are well-targeted, the costs are worth bearing. When they are not, they produce what economists call error costs: the damage done by getting the intervention wrong.

In the Google case, the error costs of over-enforcement are severe. Structural remedies that fragment Google's products could degrade services that consumers value. Banning distribution agreements could reduce the subsidies that make browsers and devices cheaper. Most importantly, aggressive intervention sends a signal to every technology company in America: if you build a product that becomes dominant because consumers prefer it, the government will eventually come to break it apart. That signal chills investment, discourages risk-taking, and ultimately harms the dynamic competition that is the best antidote to monopoly power.

The error costs of under-enforcement, by contrast, are modest and shrinking. If the court imposes a lighter remedy and Google's search dominance persists despite AI competition — an unlikely scenario — enforcers can revisit the question. Antitrust enforcement is iterative. But you cannot un-divest a company or un-disrupt a product ecosystem. The asymmetry favors restraint.

## Conclusion

The Google search antitrust case was important. It established that even in dynamic technology markets, there are lines companies cannot cross. That precedent has value.

But precedent on liability does not justify recklessness on remedy. The government's push for aggressive structural intervention in the search market is fighting the last war with blunt instruments while a new competitive landscape takes shape around it. Generative AI is doing more to disrupt Google's search dominance in two years than any remedy could accomplish in ten.

Policymakers should declare victory on the liability finding, impose targeted behavioral remedies that prevent the specific conduct the court found unlawful, and redirect their considerable energy toward the competition battles that actually matter: ensuring the AI era remains open, contestable, and dynamic. That is where the future of antitrust lives — not in relitigating the search wars of the last decade.
