summary: "After Congress twice failed to pass federal AI preemption provisions, states have flooded the zone with contradictory AI mandates in early 2026. The resulting compliance patchwork is not an exercise in federalism — it is a self-inflicted strategic liability. Congress must establish a national AI baseline built on the NIST AI Risk Management Framework before the window closes."

# The 50-State AI Nightmare: Why Congress Must Preempt the Patchwork

The window is closing. State legislatures across the country are in active session, and the tally of introduced AI-related bills has surpassed [1,000 measures in 2025 alone](https://www.troutmanprivacy.com/2026/02/proposed-state-ai-law-update-february-16-2026/) — on top of the [700-plus introduced the year before](https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2026/january/us-ai-law-update). Indiana, Kentucky, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Utah are all advancing AI or algorithmic accountability legislation in the current cycle. Texas enacted its sweeping [Responsible AI Governance Act (TRAIGA)](https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2026/january/us-ai-law-update) last June. New algorithmic pricing bills are moving in Iowa, Colorado, and North Carolina. In the absence of federal action, America is not building a thoughtful, layered regulatory architecture — it is assembling an incoherent labyrinth, one state at a time.

Congress has now failed twice to stop it. The House-passed provision in the reconciliation bill known as the ["One Big Beautiful Bill"](https://www.workforcebulletin.com/artificial-intelligence-regulation-at-a-crossroads-the-trump-administrations-preemption-push) would have imposed a ten-year moratorium on state AI enforcement. The Senate voted [99–1](https://www.workforcebulletin.com/artificial-intelligence-regulation-at-a-crossroads-the-trump-administrations-preemption-push) to strip it. Similar language in the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act [also failed](https://www.workforcebulletin.com/artificial-intelligence-regulation-at-a-crossroads-the-trump-administrations-preemption-push) to survive. President Trump's [December 2025 executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/) directing the Department of Justice to challenge offending state laws is a useful pressure valve — but it cannot substitute for the durable legislative settlement only Congress can provide.

The stakes are not abstract. A fragmented, 50-state AI regulatory regime is not a feature of American federalism. It is a strategic liability. The United States cannot sustain global AI leadership while its most innovative companies navigate a contradictory matrix of state compliance obligations. Congress must act — not because AI needs no governance, but because 50 contradictory governance regimes protect incumbents rather than consumers, and cede the initiative to Beijing.

## The Compliance Tax: How the Patchwork Crushes Challengers

The political economy of regulatory fragmentation runs counter to the instincts of the legislators who created it. Most advocates of state AI bills present themselves as counterweights to large, powerful tech companies. The actual effect is precisely the opposite.

Consider a company deploying an AI-powered hiring tool across multiple states. It must navigate Illinois's [AI Video Interview Act](https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-ai-governance-legislation-tracker) and its bias audit requirements; New York City Local Law 144 and its annual third-party audits; Colorado's automated decision-making rules; California's proposed algorithmic accountability standards; Texas TRAIGA's prohibited-use categories and affirmative defense framework; and Virginia's chatbot disclosure requirements. That is before accounting for bills still in motion in 2026 — Iowa's algorithmic pricing prohibitions, Rhode Island's rental-market AI restrictions, and whatever emerges from Indiana and Kentucky before their sessions close.

Each of these regimes uses different definitions. "Automated decision system" in one state is not "algorithmic accountability system" in the next. "High-risk AI" in Colorado does not map cleanly onto "restricted purpose AI" in Texas. What constitutes adequate disclosure in Illinois may not satisfy Virginia. The definitional chaos alone generates enormous legal overhead.

For a large incumbent with a multi-hundred-million-dollar compliance budget and dozens of regulatory attorneys, this overhead is manageable. For a 30-person AI startup competing against that incumbent, it is existential. Every engineering sprint spent on compliance localization is a sprint not spent on model improvement. Every legal hour spent parsing state-by-state definitions is an hour not spent on product. The compliance patchwork functions as a fixed cost that scales inversely with the challenger's capacity to absorb it, [entrenching concentration rather than checking it](https://itif.org/publications/2026/01/05/top-10-tech-policy-pronouncements-prognostications-and-questions-for-2026/).

This is the foundational irony: state legislators who invoke Big Tech as their villain are enacting rules that Big Tech's compliance apparatus can absorb, while foreclosing the next generation of smaller competitors before they can threaten the incumbents.

## Federalism's Actual Lesson: Interstate Commerce Is a Federal Lane

The preemption debate predictably surfaces the "laboratories of democracy" objection: states should be free to experiment, and the best approaches will bubble up. The argument has real force in domains like occupational licensing or zoning. It does not apply here.

AI systems are, by their nature, interstate. A model trained on data centers in Virginia, fine-tuned by a team in California, deployed via cloud infrastructure in Oregon, and accessed by users in all 50 states is not a local matter. The Constitution's framers vested Congress with Commerce Clause authority precisely because they understood that coordination failures across state lines require federal resolution. The classic case for federal preemption is when states impose incompatible requirements on a national market, producing compliance gridlock that harms consumers and producers alike without advancing any coherent policy goal.

That is precisely what is happening. As [Baker Botts observed in its January 2026 survey](https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2026/january/us-ai-law-update) of the AI regulatory landscape, "a patchwork of laws, regulations, and industry standards will likely remain absent Congressional action." [OpenAI made the same point directly to OSTP](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/new-executive-order-national-policy-framework-artificial-intelligence.html) in March 2025: "Federal preemption over existing or prospective state laws will require an act of Congress." Executive branch pressure on state attorneys general can buy time, but it cannot settle the underlying question of authority. Only legislation can do that.

The federalism argument also proves too much. If 50 state AI regimes represent healthy democratic experimentation, then 50 state financial disclosure regimes, 50 state pharmaceutical approval regimes, and 50 state aviation safety standards would be equally healthy. We reject all of those as incompatible with a functioning national market — because they are. AI infrastructure deserves the same analysis.

## The EU Cautionary Tale: Don't Replicate Internally What Europe Got Wrong Externally

The most instructive precedent for what America is building is not domestic. It is the European Union's experience with data regulation — and the results are damning.

Since GDPR's implementation, [venture capital investment in European technology firms has fallen 26 percent relative to the United States](https://itif.org/publications/2025/12/01/gdpr-reduced-eu-VC-investment-in-technology-26-percent-relative-to-united-states/), according to ITIF analysis. That is not a rounding error. It represents a massive transfer of innovative capacity away from a heavily regulated market. The EU AI Act, now in full enforcement rollout, is compounding the problem: regulatory uncertainty around the DMA, GDPR, and AI Act [cost Microsoft an estimated $2.3 billion in first-year Copilot revenue in Europe](https://itif.org/publications/2025/12/01/defending-american-tech-in-global-markets/) — a delay driven entirely by legal hesitation rather than any technical limitation.

The accumulated toll of EU digital regulation is staggering. ITIF calculates that five leading U.S. technology companies face a [potential $2.2 trillion in foregone revenue by 2030](https://itif.org/publications/2025/12/01/defending-american-tech-in-global-markets/) from EU regulatory constraints, translating into over $325 billion in suppressed R&D investment. Europe built a regime that protected its existing industries from American competition without producing any competitive domestic AI alternatives.

Americans have watched this unfold and drawn the right lesson — at least with respect to Europe. We have been far less attentive to the fact that we are replicating the same dynamic internally. The EU's fragmentation problem runs across 27 member states; America's runs across 50. The compliance overhead falls on the same companies, through the same mechanism: jurisdiction-specific definitions, conflicting enforcement regimes, and overlapping obligations that generate legal uncertainty before a single algorithm is deployed.

The crucial distinction: Europe's fragmentation targets foreign companies entering a unified regulatory space. America's fragmentation targets American companies in their home market. If GDPR was enough to drive a 26-percent investment gap, a domestic equivalent will not be measured in percentage points — it will be measured in market share ceded to competitors who face no equivalent burden.

## China Is Not Running This Experiment

While American AI developers parse competing state definitions of "algorithmic accountability," Beijing is executing a unified national strategy with no jurisdictional ambiguity whatsoever.

In April 2025, the Chinese Politburo made AI the focus of its study session, with President Xi Jinping [describing AI as a "strategic technology"](https://ashleydudarenok.com/china-ai-strategy/) and directing Shanghai to lead deployment. The State Council's ["AI+" initiative](https://merics.org/en/comment/chinas-ai-drive-aims-integration-across-sectors-wake-call-europe) targets AI penetration across key sectors exceeding 70 percent by 2027. In July 2025, China [announced a 13-point global AI governance roadmap](https://www.ansi.org/standards-news/all-news/8-1-25-china-announces-action-plan-for-global-ai-governance/) and proposed establishing an international AI cooperation organization — a direct bid to shape global norms from Beijing rather than Washington.

China's domestic AI governance is layered but coherent: targeted technical standards, national labeling requirements, and sector-specific mandates all point in the same strategic direction. As of 2025, [China has filed 1.57 million AI patents](https://ashleydudarenok.com/china-ai-strategy/) — 38.6 percent of the global total. Morgan Stanley projects China's AI market will reach [$1.4 trillion by 2030](https://ashleydudarenok.com/china-ai-strategy/).

The asymmetry is not rhetorical. It is a national security gap. When American AI developers spend engineering resources achieving compliance with Iowa's algorithmic pricing law, Colorado's automated decision-making rules, and Virginia's chatbot disclosure requirements — separately, on different timelines, under different definitions — those resources are not going into model capability, safety research, or competitive deployment. The patchwork does not merely impose costs; it redirects the attention of America's most productive AI talent from building to navigating. China does not have this problem. That is not an advertisement for authoritarian governance — it is an observation about the strategic consequences of regulatory incoherence, and it should concentrate the minds of every member of Congress who votes on AI bills.

## The Right Model: NIST AI RMF as the National Baseline

None of this argues that AI needs no governance. The argument is about *where* rules come from and *whether they are coherent*. There is already a technically credible, institutionally appropriate foundation for a federal baseline: the [NIST AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2023/01/26/AI%20RMF%201.0.pdf).

The NIST AI RMF is not perfect, and it is not comprehensive. But it has decisive advantages over the current state-by-state approach. It was developed through an open, multi-stakeholder process that included industry, civil society, and government — not rushed through a state legislature in response to a news cycle. It is technically literate: it maps to actual AI system development and deployment practices rather than importing misaligned consumer-protection concepts. Leading AI developers are already adopting it as a genuine operational framework. And — critically — several states already treat NIST AI RMF compliance as a [safe harbor or affirmative defense](https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2026/january/us-ai-law-update): Texas's TRAIGA is explicitly structured around it, and California and Colorado have built similar references into their frameworks.

This points toward a practical congressional path. Legislation establishing the NIST AI RMF as a federal baseline — mandatory for covered applications, with sector-specific supplements administered by existing regulators (FDA for medical AI, CFPB for financial AI, EEOC for employment AI) — would accomplish several things simultaneously. It would create a single national compliance target, eliminating patchwork overhead. It would preempt state AI mandates that exceed the federal floor on covered applications. It would preserve rigorous governance for genuinely high-risk deployments while avoiding the overreach that drives compliance paralysis. And it would give American AI developers the legal certainty they need to build — and to compete.

This is the rationalization model, not the deregulation model. The Trump administration's [December 2025 executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/) correctly diagnoses the problem and sets a [March 11, 2026 deadline](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/new-executive-order-national-policy-framework-artificial-intelligence.html) for the Commerce Secretary to identify state laws for DOJ challenge. That is a useful pressure mechanism — not a substitute for legislation. Courts will take years to resolve preemption challenges, and the DOJ litigation strategy faces genuine statutory authority questions. Congress can resolve the uncertainty now, while the state legislative calendar is still shaping what the patchwork will look like in 2027 and beyond.

## Why Congress Will Act — If It Acts Soon

The 99–1 Senate vote against the moratorium provision reflects real political dynamics: senators from both parties are reluctant to strip their state counterparts of legislative authority on a high-salience issue. The federalism instinct is not irrational politics; it is deeply embedded in the Senate's institutional identity.

But the political calculus is shifting. The state legislative flood of early 2026 is creating exactly the kind of visible, concrete crisis that raises the cost of inaction. When a constituent startup cannot afford to comply with 15 different state AI regimes and considers moving operations offshore, or when a healthcare or financial AI deployment is blocked by one state's idiosyncratic definition, the abstract case for federal action becomes a constituent service problem.

Congressional staffers and White House OSTP officials should take note: the window for a clean federal solution is narrowing. Every state that enacts a new AI law creates a new constituency for that law's survival. Every compliance infrastructure built around state-specific rules creates sunk costs that complicate future rationalization. The longer Congress waits, the messier the preemption question becomes — and the more entrenched the interests that will resist it.

The [five key AI fights of 2026](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5657624-5-key-ai-fights-to-watch-in-2026/) tracked by close observers share a common thread: the absence of a coherent federal framework forces every contested question into a multi-jurisdictional dispute. Federal preemption built on the NIST AI RMF is not the most dramatic intervention Congress could make. It is the most consequential — and the most achievable.

## Policy Recommendations

**1. Establish a federal AI baseline statute** designating the NIST AI Risk Management Framework as the national compliance standard for covered AI applications, administered through existing sector-specific regulators.

**2. Include express preemption language** displacing state AI mandates that exceed the federal floor on covered applications, while preserving state authority over government procurement, consumer fraud enforcement under existing law, and targeted protections such as deepfake-specific criminal statutes.

**3. Build in mandatory framework updates** requiring NIST to revise the AI RMF on a biennial basis, with notice-and-comment, to ensure the national baseline tracks capability developments — addressing the core weakness of static horizontal regulation.

**4. Direct sector-specific agencies** — FDA, CFPB, EEOC, DOT — to issue binding guidance implementing the NIST baseline within their existing statutory authority within 18 months of enactment.

**5. Create a federal safe harbor** for AI developers that have completed a documented NIST AI RMF conformance assessment, providing presumptive legal protection against state AI liability claims on covered applications.

America's global AI leadership is not guaranteed. It is a function of conditions: the availability of talent, compute, capital, and — crucially — the legal clarity to deploy AI systems at scale without navigating 50 sets of contradictory rules. Congress built those conditions for the internet economy. It built them for the pharmaceutical industry. It must build them for AI.

The laboratories of democracy are valuable institutions. They are not the right venue for setting the terms of America's most consequential technological competition. That is what Congress is for.
