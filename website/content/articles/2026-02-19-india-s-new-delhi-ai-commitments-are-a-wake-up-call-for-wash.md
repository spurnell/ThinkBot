Washington's inward pivot is creating a dangerous vacuum that China is watching closely. The right US response is engagement, not abdication."

# India's New Delhi AI Commitments Are a Wake-Up Call for Washington

The [India AI Impact Summit](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/16/india-hosts-ai-impact-summit-drawing-world-leaders-tech-giants) concludes today in New Delhi with a significant geopolitical fact on the table: the Global South just put itself at the center of international AI governance, and Washington was ambivalent about being in the room.

The summit's headline deliverable is the [New Delhi Frontier AI Commitments Framework](https://sundayguardianlive.com/india/what-is-the-new-delhi-frontier-ai-commitments-framework-india-unveils-global-push-for-inclusive-multilingual-responsible-ai-at-ai-impact-summit-2026-171199/) — a voluntary agreement among leading AI firms to publish anonymized data on AI's real-world impacts and to develop multilingual evaluation benchmarks designed to serve underrepresented languages and cultural contexts. It is non-binding, principles-based, and consensus-driven — exactly the governance model sound AI policy demands. And yet, the US government's posture this week has been at best ambivalent and at worst strategically incoherent.

That needs to change.

## What India Actually Built

Strip away the summit pageantry — the 20 heads of state, the [group photograph of Modi with Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, and Dario Amodei](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/19/world-leaders-discuss-ai-future-at-indias-global-summit-in-new-delhi) — and what India has constructed is something of genuine institutional significance. This was the fourth in the global AI governance summit series (following Bletchley Park, Seoul, and Paris) and the [first held in a developing nation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/16/india-hosts-ai-impact-summit-drawing-world-leaders-tech-giants). India is not merely attending the conversation; it is building the infrastructure to host it.

The New Delhi Framework's two pillars are substantively modest but strategically shrewd. Pillar One asks AI companies to share anonymized, aggregated usage data to inform evidence-based policymaking on employment and productivity — useful for governments that need real numbers, not lobbying-inflected projections. Pillar Two commits signatories to building multilingual AI evaluation benchmarks for underserved languages. These are not radical demands. They are sensible asks from a country of 1.4 billion people whose citizens speak hundreds of languages and who will not benefit from AI systems benchmarked only on English-language tasks.

This is governance through consensus, not coercion. It deserves respect on those terms.

## Modi's Open AI Doctrine: Right Instinct, Needs Guardrails

Prime Minister Modi made the most consequential remarks of the summit. ["We believe AI will benefit the world only when it is shared,"](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2026/feb/19/modi-pitches-india-global-artificial-intelligence-hub-ai-conference/) he said, invoking "sunlight is the best disinfectant" as a metaphor for open-code AI development. He explicitly rejected treating AI as a "confidential strategic asset."

The empirical case for open-source AI is strong. The proliferation of capable open-weight models — Meta's Llama series, Mistral, and India's own Sarvam — has democratized AI development, fostered competition, and undercut the argument that only a handful of closed-model labs can produce safe AI. Modi's instincts align with the evidence.

But voluntary openness is not the same as mandated disclosure. If the New Delhi Framework's "openness" provisions evolve from aspiration into obligation — pressuring frontier AI labs to expose model weights, training methodologies, or safety research under the banner of equitable access — that would be a different matter entirely. The US should engage in the framework's ongoing development specifically to ensure that distinction holds. Open-source AI is a competitive strength, not a regulatory concession to be extracted.

## The Guterres Fund: Shape It Before China Does

[UN Secretary-General Guterres called for a $3 billion Global Fund for AI](https://news.un.org/en/story/2026/02/1166996) to build AI capacity across the developing world, covering skills, data, and compute access. "Less than one per cent of the annual revenue of a single tech company," he said, pointedly. He warned that AI's future "cannot be left to the whims of a few billionaires."

The rhetorical framing warrants scrutiny. State-directed capital allocation for AI development is not an efficient model — the history of government-managed technology funds is a history of political capture, misallocated resources, and entrenched incumbents. Private investment, bilateral partnerships, and targeted technical assistance programs are more effective and more flexible.

But the conversation about AI capacity-building in the Global South is going to happen whether or not Washington participates. [China's Global AI Governance Initiative](https://www.cigionline.org/articles/chinas-ai-governance-initiative-and-its-geopolitical-ambitions/), launched by President Xi Jinping in 2023, has been actively courting developing nations with a doctrine of "digital sovereignty" and no-strings-attached AI partnerships. Beijing sent a [vice-ministerial delegation to New Delhi](https://www.indiamanufacturingreview.com/manufacturing/news/china-to-attend-india-ai-summit-signalling-warming-tech-ties-nwid-10614.html) this week — a deliberate diplomatic signal.

If the US declines to shape how the Global South accesses AI infrastructure, Beijing will fill that vacuum. The right move is to engage the Guterres fund architecture early, push for criteria that favor private-sector implementation over state-directed programs, and use the process to advance US-aligned governance norms. Shunning the conversation is not a strategy; it is an abdication.

## Washington's Inward Turn Is a Vulnerability

The Trump administration's AI executive order — which correctly focused on preempting a patchwork of conflicting state AI mandates — was the right call on domestic federalism grounds. But it said nearly nothing about international AI governance architecture. Meanwhile, the Biden-era decision to place India outside the Tier 1 list for advanced AI chip exports [remains in effect](https://foreignpolicy.com/2026/02/18/ai-summit-india-tech-united-states/), constraining a democratic partner's access to the hardware it needs to build AI independence from China. Trade adviser Peter Navarro's question — "Why are Americans paying for AI in India?" — captures a transactional instinct that is strategically myopic.

The US government sent a senior delegation to New Delhi, led by chief scientific adviser Michael Kratsios. That is welcome. But attending a summit is not the same as having a governance strategy. Washington needs a credible, proactive AI diplomacy doctrine that treats allies like India as partners in norm-setting, not just markets for hardware sales.

## The Strategic Play

India's New Delhi Framework is not a threat to American AI leadership. It is an invitation — from a democratic, English-proficient, tech-forward nation of 1.4 billion — to co-author the governance norms that will shape AI deployment across the developing world for the next decade.

The US should take that invitation seriously. American frontier labs are already there: Altman, Pichai, and Amodei posed for the photograph. American capital is committed: Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have pledged tens of billions in India AI infrastructure. The missing piece is American governmental engagement commensurate with those commercial stakes.

Governance by consensus beats governance by coercion. The New Delhi Framework got that right. Now Washington needs to show up and help write the fine print — before someone else does.
