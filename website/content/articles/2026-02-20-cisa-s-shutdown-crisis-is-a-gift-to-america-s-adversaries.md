summary: "The DHS partial shutdown has furloughed 62% of CISA's already-depleted workforce, gutting America's primary cyber defense agency at the precise moment nation-state adversaries are running coordinated campaigns against U.S. critical infrastructure. Congress has straightforward tools to fix this — and no excuse not to use them."

# CISA's Shutdown Crisis Is a Gift to America's Adversaries

America's cyber adversaries don't observe congressional recesses. As of this morning, the federal government's primary cyber defense agency is operating with 38% of a workforce that was already a third smaller than it was a year ago. The DHS partial shutdown, now in its seventh day, has [furloughed 1,453 of CISA's 2,341 employees](https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2026/02/cisa-furlough-most-its-workforce-under-impending-dhs-shutdown/411424/) — 62% of the staff responsible for coordinating defense of the nation's power grid, water systems, hospitals, and financial networks. Chinese, Russian, Iranian, and North Korean operators don't care about Washington's budget fights. The political standoff that produced this situation is a strategic self-own.

This is not an argument for bigger government. It is an argument for competent government. Cybersecurity of critical infrastructure is a core sovereign function — as much a national defense obligation as standing up aircraft carriers. Treating CISA as discretionary spending is not fiscal conservatism; it is unilateral disarmament.

## The Numbers Are Damning

The shutdown didn't find CISA at full strength. Before February 14, the agency had [already shed close to a third of its workforce](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-departures-trump-workforce-purge/749796/) through buyouts, early retirements, and reduction programs — dropping from roughly 3,400 staff at the start of 2025 to approximately 2,341 by the time the funding lapse hit. The furlough then removed another 1,453 employees overnight, leaving 888 "excepted" staff to cover the entire critical infrastructure portfolio.

To put that in concrete terms: fewer than 900 federal employees are now responsible for coordinating the cybersecurity of sixteen critical infrastructure sectors covering a $25 trillion economy. The [acting CISA director has acknowledged](https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-shutdown-impact-dhs-funding-testimony/) that the funding lapse is limiting — and in some cases halting — agency work. Proactive vulnerability scanning has been sharply curtailed. Security advisories are delayed. Sector coordination calls are not happening.

The 888 excepted staff are keeping the lights on. They are not running a fully functional national cyber defense operation.

## The Threat Environment Didn't Take the Week Off

The timing is not academic. The weeks surrounding the shutdown have been among the most active on record for exploited vulnerabilities. [Google patched an actively exploited Chrome zero-day](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/new-chrome-zero-day-cve-2026-2441-under.html) in February 2026 — a use-after-free flaw in CSS enabling remote code execution via crafted web pages. Microsoft's February Patch Tuesday fixed [six actively exploited zero-days](https://www.securityweek.com/6-actively-exploited-zero-days-patched-by-microsoft-with-february-2026-updates/) across Windows SmartScreen, Office, Remote Desktop Services, and Desktop Window Manager — the kind of vulnerability suite that nation-state actors weaponize at scale.

Meanwhile, [Google's Threat Intelligence Group has linked China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea to coordinated campaigns](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/google-links-china-iran-russia-north.html) targeting defense-sector organizations, leveraging AI-enhanced capabilities for automated attacks, deepfake social engineering, and critical infrastructure pre-positioning. These are not opportunistic criminal actors. They are state-sponsored operations running on continuous cycles with long-term strategic objectives.

CISA's value in this environment is not merely headcount. Its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) — a curated, authoritative list of flaws under active exploitation — functions as a free security subsidy to tens of thousands of private-sector organizations that lack the threat intelligence resources of a Goldman Sachs or a Lockheed Martin. Every advisory CISA doesn't issue, every sector coordination call that doesn't happen, every proactive scan that gets skipped is a debt the private sector will eventually pay — measured in breach costs, ransomware payments, and compromised infrastructure.

## The Political Irony Is Brutal

The budget standoff that triggered this shutdown centered on immigration enforcement. The outcome is perverse: according to [reporting on how the shutdown affects different DHS components](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/government-shutdown/2026/02/how-a-dhs-shutdown-affects-different-components-and-employees/), ICE enforcement operations are continuing because their funding flows through the President's reconciliation vehicle. The political flashpoint that caused the shutdown is fully funded. The agency defending U.S. critical infrastructure from nation-state hackers is running at skeleton crew capacity.

This is not a commentary on immigration enforcement priorities. It is an observation about strategic incoherence. A government that furloughs its cyber defenders while maintaining full enforcement operations has revealed something important about how it weights sovereign responsibilities. Adversaries have noticed.

## CIRCIA Is the Long-Term Casualty

The immediate damage — degraded scanning, delayed advisories, halted coordination — is recoverable. The longer-term casualty may not be. The Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act's implementing regulations were [already pushed to May 2026](https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-pushes-final-cyber-incident-reporting-rule-to-may-2026/) after industry pushback on the proposed rule's scope and compliance burden. With CISA operating at a fraction of capacity, that timeline is now in serious jeopardy.

CIRCIA's 72-hour incident reporting requirement — whatever its implementation flaws, which are real and worth debating — would give the federal government its first systematic, real-time picture of large-scale cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. Without it, America flies blind. The country currently has no legal framework for understanding the aggregate scope of attacks against its most essential systems. Every day CIRCIA implementation slips is another day the U.S. lacks the situational awareness to mount a coherent strategic response.

## The Fix Is Straightforward

Congress has all the tools it needs to resolve this without a grand bargain. Two paths are available.

The first is administrative: the White House Office of Management and Budget has authority under the Antideficiency Act to formally designate CISA's core functions — KEV catalog maintenance, vulnerability scanning, cybersecurity advisories, CIRCIA implementation — as "essential" services that continue during a funding lapse. This requires no new legislation.

The second is legislative: Congress can pass a standalone appropriations vehicle funding DHS cyber functions independently of the broader budget dispute. A clean carve-out for CISA operations is a bipartisan minimum — the kind of narrow, defensible action that members on both sides of the aisle can justify to any constituency. Hardening America's critical infrastructure against Chinese and Russian hackers is not a Democratic or Republican position. It is a basic national security obligation.

Legitimate debates about CISA's scope, staffing levels, and long-term effectiveness deserve serious attention. But the alternative to a functional cyber defense agency is a dysfunctional one — and the people who benefit most from that outcome are not American. Congress should pass a CISA funding carve-out before the weekend.
